# Test Project | Match Invaders 

*Test project for applicants*: Requires **Unity 2019.4.5f1**. 

## Goal 

Implement a small game based on two different game mechanics (Space Invaders and Match 3). 

- Don't spend more than 6-8 hours *for coding* on it. 
- Concentrate on the gameplay experience, data structures, architecture and separation of concerns. 
- Everything in the project is used for your reference, you can use any of the assets or completely remove all of them.
- You aren't required to use the provided assets, you can use unity default shapes, build your own, make the game work in 3D, or put some sprites together to get a desired shape. *You won't be evaluated in your 3D/2D skills*, instead **the subject of evaluation will be**:
    - The implementation of the requirements.
    - The code quality.
    - Your proficiency with the Unity Engine.

# Requirements

Read the [REQUIREMENTS.md](https://github.com/innerspacetrainings/Application-Match-Invaders/blob/master/REQUIREMENTS.md) before starting

Remember to read both this *README* and the *REQUIREMENTS* before starting to work on the project.

## Implementation 

- Clone this repository. 
- Develop as you would do in a normal project. 
- Do not use copyright/third party libraries. 
- Upload this project to a public or private repository in your account and invite [Bullrich](http://github.com/bullrich/) to it. 

## Delivery 

### Before implementation 

- Split the requirements into sub tasks and estimate the time it would take for each one. 
- Inform  <javier.bullrich@innerspace.eu> about the estimations. 
- Optionally, contact Javier Bullrich for requirements clarification. 

### Implementation 

- Functional build for x64 machines. 

### After implementation 

- Comment the execution time for each issue closed. You can also add some extra information explaining why a task took less or more time than the estimated.
- Review the project (what you learn, where you struggle, what you liked from what you did, if we should pay attention on a particular piece of the project). You can use the *Review.md* for this. 
- Tag the final commit as "Release" and [upload the build to the GitHub releases page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository).  
- Inform Javier Bullrich of the finished projects. 

## Evaluation criteria 

- Project completion (provided build and project) 
- Whole feel of the game
- User experience
- Structure of the 
    - project (scene ordering, how you set up components, nesting, etc)
    - code (how you define entry points, connections between scripts and nest your logic)
- How and which software patterns you use. 
- Maintainability and cleanliness of your code. 
- How you test your code. 
- Creativity
